<p>
  It is that time of the year: the MalmöMilen 10 km race is coming on June 13. This time again I will participate.
</p>

<p>
  Once again, it is interesting to estimate our expected position / level / rank before even starting running. <br>
  To do so, it is possible to scrap the available data and visualize the start groups distribution.
</p>

<p>
   The stats are compiled in the following <a class="bigger" href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/jtuloup/bb218bf22605d56ab670">Jupyter Notebook</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Now that we are all well informed, we can serenely go back to training and stay cool-minded. <br>
  See you on the track!
