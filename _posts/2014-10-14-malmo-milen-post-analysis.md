One of my previous posts was about the start group distribution for the MalmöMilen race that happened in June 2014. <br>
This time let's focus on the follow-up of this race.
</p>

<p>
I had a few questions in mind right after the race and told myself that I will do a "post-race" analysis one day. <br>
The results are available for free, and easy to retrieve with a few lines of code from this web page:<br>

</p>

<p>
So I finally took the time to answer the few questions that have been in my mind since. Those are simple stats and I am sure there is even more to mine from this data. <br>

This time again I used an iPython notebook, it is such a convenient tool for this kind of exercise! <br>
There it is: <br>

Any question, please let me know!
