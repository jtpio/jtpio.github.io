It is that time of the year: the MalmöMilen 10 km race is coming on June 13. This time again I will participate.

Once again, it is interesting to estimate our expected position / level / rank before even starting running.

To do so, it is possible to scrap the available data and visualize the start groups distribution.

The stats are compiled in the following [Jupyter Notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/jtuloup/bb218bf22605d56ab670).

Now that we are all well informed, we can serenely go back to training and stay cool-minded.

See you on the track!
