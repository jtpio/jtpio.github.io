## Visualizing the data

I use Trello everyday to organize my personal life. I have been using it for more than a year, especially to log and organize articles and videos found on the Web.

Recently I have decided to compile a list of stats to learn more about myself, my reading habits and what I really like.

The first part of the analysis focuses on visualizing and understanding the data.

Everything is explained in the following Jupyter Notebook. Go and check it out!

## Next steps

There is many more advanced things to do from here:

- More elaborated stats.
- Given a link, title and labels for an article, predict when I will read it.
- Cluster articles and links by similarity, as another way to visualize data.

Those are just ideas at the present moment. I will share my next findings in a future "Part 2"!

Happy reading.
