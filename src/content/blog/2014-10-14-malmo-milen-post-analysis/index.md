One of my previous posts was about the start group distribution for the MalmöMilen race that happened in June 2014.

This time let's focus on the follow-up of this race.

I had a few questions in mind right after the race and told myself that I will do a "post-race" analysis one day.

The results are available for free, and easy to retrieve with a few lines of code from this web page:

So I finally took the time to answer the few questions that have been in my mind since. Those are simple stats and I am sure there is even more to mine from this data.

This time again I used a Jupyter notebook, it is such a convenient tool for this kind of exercise!

There it is: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jtpio/data-playground/blob/master/malmomilen/MalmoMilen_post.ipynb
